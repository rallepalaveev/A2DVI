# A2DVI - Apple II Digital Video

This is a project for a digital DVI/HDMI Apple II video card.
It directly produces a digital video stream from Apple II's memory content.
The signal is output via an HDMI connector, connecting the Apple II to modern displays with HDMI (or DVI) inputs.
No more analog signal conversion required.

The project is a collaboration with Thorsten Brehm. His related firmware project is here: https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware

For the DVI output to be active, the new firmware developed by Thorsten should be used.

The card also has an alternative analog VGA connector.
For the VGA output to be active, the [VGA firmware](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA) developed by Mark Aikens should be used.

The card can produce either an analog VGA or a digital HDMI signal, but not both simultaneously.
To switch between modes, a firmware update is required and opening/closing connections.

As of v2.0 VGA function is not supported - the card is DVI only.

V2.2 has an onboard driver to invoke the configuation utility by PR#N, where N is the slot number.

V2.3 is a TH version with 74HC245 and requires a DVI break-out board.

V2.4 is a TH version with 74HC244 and requires a DVI break-out board.

## Procedure to activate DVI mode
* v1.2:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico;
  remove U6 and disconnect pins 11, 12 and 13 of U5.
* v1.5:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico;
  open all 9 DIP switches.
* v1.6:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico;
  desloder the 8 soldering pads at GPIOs 14-21.
* v1.7:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico;
  desloder the 8 soldering pads at GPIOs 14-21; remove VGA sub-board and ribbon cable.
* v2.0:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico.
* v2.2:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico.
* v2.3:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico.
* v2.4:
  program [A2DVI-Firmware](https://github.com/ThorstenBr/A2DVI-Firmware) to RPI Pico.
  
## Procedure to activate VGA mode
* v1.2:
  program [VGA firmware](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA) to RPI Pico;
  replace U5 and U6.
* v1.5:
  program [VGA firmware](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA) to RPI Pico;
  close all 9 DIP switches.
* v1.6:
  program [VGA firmware](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA) to RPI Pico;
  sloder the 8 soldering pads at GPIOs 14-21.
* v1.7:
  program [VGA firmware](https://github.com/markadev/AppleII-VGA) to RPI Pico;
  sloder the 8 soldering pads at GPIOs 14-21; connect VGA sub-board to main board by the ribbon cable.
* v2.0:
  N.A. - v2.0 is HDMI only.
* v2.2:
  N.A. - v2.2 is HDMI only.
* v2.3:
  N.A. - v2.3 is HDMI only.
* v2.4:
  N.A. - v2.4 is HDMI only.

Note: In versions 2.3 and 2.4 I experimented with replacing the 8x 270-ohms resistors on the DVI lines by 100pF capacitors to achieve better separation form potential 3.3V DC leak from the screen; while this worked, some screens are more prone to noise and results may still be better with the 270-ohms resistors.
  
## Dual-Language Support
The pin on the v1.5 and later boards is for AltChr connection, supported by A2DVI firmware for switching between alternative character sets on non-US versions of Apple II ("Euro-machines").

# Hardware
* Based on the PICO controller board.
* Provides a DVI video stream via an HDMI connector.
* Low power/heat dissipation: less than 70mA@5V = 0.35W in operation.
* Uses 4x 74LV245 bus transceivers for 5V/3.3V signal conversion of the Apple II bus.
* Separate ALTCHR input pin for dual-language support: pin needs to be wired separately to the "language switch" of Euro-Apple IIs (optional).
